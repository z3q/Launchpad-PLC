# CardReader_RFID_RC522
Library and example for TI MSP430 LaunchPads and Energia that reads a card number using a RC522 MIFARE module, takes action depending on the card number, and prints it to the serial monitor. The difference from original library is in economy of the Reset pin by connecting it to VCC. 

Tested with Energia V16 on the following LaunchPads:

          MSP-EXP430G2553 LaunchPad
          MSP-EXP430F5529 LaunchPad
          MSP-EXP430FR5969 LaunchPad
